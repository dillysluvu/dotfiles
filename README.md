# Dotfiles

This is my config file, yeah, but it's not really mine because I referenced it from many sources. Sorry that I don't remember to cite the sources I referenced, but if you're interested in my config, you can simply run a few commands, like me:

## Installation

1. Initialize a directory for configuration data:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/Projects
    cd ~/Projects
    ```

2. Clone my config:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dillysluvu/dotfiles.git
    ```

3. Run the setup program:
    ```sh
    chmod +x setup.command
    ./setup.command
    ```
